## Prediction of Surviving the Titanic(KNN Classifier)
The project will be a success if we are able to create a model that will accurately determine whether or not a passenger survives or not given their specific features in the titanic ship. We will use accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report as the metrics for testing perfomance of our models.

### Context
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. This unfortunate incident resulted in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this analysis we will explore the data to understand which group of people had a better chance at surviving and then later build a model to predict what sorts of people were more likely to survive using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## E-mail Spam Detection (Naive-Bayes Classifier)
We use AUC_ROC Score, confusion matrix and classification report as the metrics for testing perfomance of our models as the metric of success in this project

### Context
SPAMBASE was taken from UCI machine learning repository and was created by Mark Hopkins, Erik Reeber, George Forman, and Jaap Suermondt. This dataset contains 4601 email messages and 58 attributes. This dataset collection of non-spam email came from filled work, personal e-mail and single e-mail account. This dataset is composed of a selection of mail messages, suitable for use in testing spam filtering systems. Each instance in SPAMBASE consists of 58 attributes. Most of the attributes represent the frequency of a given word or character in the email that corresponds to the instance.
